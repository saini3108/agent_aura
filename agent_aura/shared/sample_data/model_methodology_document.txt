Model Name: Personal Credit Risk Scorecard

1. MODEL OVERVIEW

1.1 Purpose
This document describes the methodology for the Personal Credit Risk Scorecard used to assess the probability of default for consumer credit applications.

1.2 Scope
- Consumer loans ranging from $5,000 to $50,000
- Unsecured personal loans with terms of 12-60 months
- Applicants aged 18-75 with verifiable income

2. DATA REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Input Variables
Required fields for model scoring:
- Credit Score (300-850 range)
- Annual Income (verified)
- Employment Years (current position)
- Debt-to-Income Ratio
- Home Ownership Status
- Loan Purpose
- Age of Applicant

2.2 Data Sources
- Credit Bureau Reports (Experian primary)
- Income Verification (bank statements, pay stubs)
- Application Data
- Internal Customer History

3. MODEL DEVELOPMENT

3.1 Statistical Approach
Logistic regression model with binary outcome:
- Target Variable: Default Flag (1=Default, 0=No Default)
- Default Definition: 90+ days past due within 12 months

3.2 Variable Selection
Forward stepwise selection based on:
- Statistical significance (p < 0.05)
- Business intuition
- Regulatory compliance
- Model stability

3.3 Model Equation
Log(odds) = β0 + β1*CreditScore + β2*DTI + β3*Income + β4*Employment + β5*Age
